# Tuna Mobile Application

A React Native app designed to provide a CMS managed menu and a newsfeed.

The content used by the app is generated from a JSON feed which is cached on the app. Currently the JSON feed is generated by a view in Drupal which outputs specific content as JSON. The app is built to expand with additional modules such as the "Time to Breath" tool which is a breathing timer, and the "Scrapbook" which enables users to save content and personal notes to the app for future reference.

The scrapbook functions will be accessible by other apps which may share to it from the native device app sharing functionality. For example the user may save an image or song to their scrapbook and store it with their comment about it.

An "Activities" section on the app use a web browser to access the online quiz, assessment and activities section included content which is provided for by the main website.

The app includes "Company" content which is also fed into the app by a JSON feed and which includes the companies GPS data. This GPS data is to be used as part of an app based mapping system which will use the users location to order the services presented.
